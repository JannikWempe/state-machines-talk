      "An eye movement-based methodology and assessment tool may be used to quantify many aspects of human dynamic visual processing using a relatively simple and short oculomotor task, noninvasive video-based eye tracking, and validated oculometric analysis techniques. By examining the eye movement responses to a task including a radially-organized appropriately randomized sequence of Rashbass-like step-ramp pursuit-tracking trials, distinct performance measurements may be generated that may be associated with, for example, pursuit initiation (e.g., latency and open-loop pursuit acceleration), steady-state tracking (e.g., gain, catch-up saccade amplitude, and the proportion of the steady-state response consisting of smooth movement), direction tuning (e.g., oblique effect amplitude, horizontal-vertical asymmetry, and direction noise), and speed tuning (e.g., speed responsiveness and noise). This quantitative approach may provide fast and results (e.g., a multi-dimensional set of oculometrics and a single scalar impairment index) that can be interpreted by one without a high degree of scientific sophistication or extensive training.",

      "Dynamic visual processing remains difficult to assess clinically, due at least in part to the lack of a readily-available assessment tool and a codified set of performance standards. Severe impairments in dynamic visual function can stem from a large number of causes, including: stroke, traumatic brain injury, autism, Alzheimers disease, schizophrenia, degenerative retinal disease, drug toxicity, aging, and spaceflight-induced visual impairment. To assess various aspects of dynamic visual function including peripheral attention, peripheral spatial localization, perceptual motion processing, and oculomotor responsiveness, we developed a simple fifteen-minute clinical test that measures and computes ten eye-movement-based, i.e., oculometric, measures. Our oculometric tool may be useful to clinicians to localize affected brain regions following trauma, degenerative disease, or aging, to characterize and quantify clinical deficits, to monitor recovery of function after injury, and to detect altered or impaired visual performance at sub-clinical levels. This sensitive assessment tool has immediate applicability as a screening tool by comparing the oculometric measures of an individual to a normal baseline population, or from the same individual before and after exposure to a potentially-traumatic event (e.g., a boxing match, football game, combat tour, space mission), or on an ongoing basis to monitor performance as it returns to baseline following injury. Applications of our oculometric tool include screening: patients for deficits in visual function; pilot candidates based upon inherent dynamic visual capabilities; patients, players, or soldiers for recovery by periodic reassessment following injury; automobile drivers as they age; and astronaut visual status before and after a mission.",

(~2.4-mm) diameter has been developed for localized delivery of microwave radiation for heating (and thus killing) diseased tissue without excessively heating nearby healthy tissue. By \"localized\" is meant that the antenna radiates much more in one radial direction than in the opposite radial direction, so that it heats tissue much more on one side than it does on the opposite side. Prior compact, cylindrical antennas designed for therapeutic localized hyperthermia do not exhibit such directionality: that is, they radiate in approximately axisymmetric patterns. Prior directional antennas designed for the same purpose have been, variously, (1) too large to fit within catheters or (2) too large, after deployment from catheters, to fit within the confines of most human organs. In contrast, the present antenna offers a high degree of directionality and is compact enough to be useable as a catheter in some applications.",

      "This technology is an improved method of designing complexly shaped inflatable shells to be assembled from gores. The method addresses problems associated with the assembly, folding, transport, and deployment of inflatable shells that may comprise multiple layers and have complex shapes that can include such doubly curved surfaces as toroids and spheres. Mathematically defining fold lines on a gore pattern in a double- curvature region is difficult. It is a common practice to design an inflatable shell to be assembled in the deployed configuration, without regard for the need to fold it into compact form. Typically, the result has been that folding has been a difficult, time-consuming process resulting in a poor stowed configuration. With this method, one chooses the sizes and shapes of the gores and the fold lines, in conjunction with the sequence of incorporation of the gores, to enable assembly of the shell in the stowed configuration, without interference between layers.",

In operation, a cooled cryogen is pumped through the upstream cold box into the pipe being tested. Both ends of the pipe are held at a constant temperature, so the heat transfer is eliminated in the axial direction and is limited to the radial direction. A precise measurement of the rate of heat leak into the process fluid is needed in this process. The technology operates on the theory that the heat leak is equal to the boiloff rate multiplied by the latent heat of vaporization. A heat leak rate is computed while maintaining the temperature of the cold boxes at the end of the pipe and measuring the boiloff rate. Thermally isolated valves, plumbing, and safety devices within the cold boxes allow for convenient and efficient controls and a repeatable procedure.

In space, the lack of a true diurnal cycle of sunlight, encompassing the same range of color temperatures and intensities of sunlight experienced on Earth, is one of the potential causes of sleep disorders among the crew aboard ISS. The production of melatonin, a hormone that helps regulate sleep cycles, can be inhibited by light, especially cool white light (with its large blue light component). To help regulate sleep cycles and improve the quality of sleep for the crew, control of the melatonin production cycle through the use of light is key. On Earth, this technology can be used to help treat many sleep disorders, including jet lag, shift work sleep disorder, delayed sleep phase syndrome, advance sleep phase syndrome, and non-24-hour sleep/wake disorder (frequently affects those who are totally blind since the circadian clock is set by the light-dark cycle over a 24-hour period).",

For true global measurement, these radar and radiometers needs to be deployed in low earth orbit (LEO) or geostationary orbit (GEO). However, for achieving reasonable spatial resolution and temporal resolution, these remote sensing instruments become complex and expensive to deploy in LEO/GEO. In order to reduce mission cost and deployment time, there is a need for alternative techniques which are based on using already existing EM signals transmitted by communication transmitters. Currently, the transceiver used for small satellite applications use antennas that are omnidirectional. These receivers will indiscriminately receive signals incident from all directions and will not have capability to suppress RF signals incident from unwanted directions.

Customary IQI devices for 2D radiography are typically flat; however, since CT data is inherently volumetric, flat objects offer an unrealistic basis for a standard. Many known CT IQIs are known as disc phantoms and intended for medical inspection purposes or defines resolution based on the modulation transfer function calculated across the exterior edge of a round coupon. While this may be sufficient for an indirect and relative assessment, the image sharpness of the exterior edge may be not representative of interior boundaries and only serves as an indirect measure. These IQIs are also not ideal for capturing actual system performance under real life, application-defined settings. For industrial applications of CT, an IQI should be able to accommodate a much broader range of possible scan settings.

In the HCPCF lamp, plasma is generated along the length of the fiber and excited by a coil, producing UV light. The longer the fiber, the more light is generated; this increases the clock signal-to-noise ratio and leads to an improvement in clock short-term stability.

This rapid and cost-effective technique yields a uniform etched surface with extremely low reflectivity of visible and infrared (IR) radiation and near-zero transmission, resulting in a high-emissivity surface. Specifically, total emissivity is greater than 99.5 percent for wavelengths between 400 nm and 2,500 nm. This high level of light absorption is possible thanks to the needle-like nanotips (1- to 150-&micro;m long and 0.3- to 5-&micro;m wide, depending upon the parameters utilized) etched into a highly absorbing doped silicon substrate.

R2's nearly 50 patented and patent-pending technologies have the potential to be game-changers in many applications such as the industrial environments. For example, in a traditional robotic assembly line there are multiple specialized robots that are tooled for a small set of unique tasks. R2 provides an alternative way to implement automated assembly using extraordinary task flexibility, dexterity and rapid interchangeability with human processes and tools. This can lower automation infrastructure costs and increase manufacturing flexibility. R2 can serve as an assistant or work independently. R2's dexterity is a key feature in industrial environments as the robot can handle factory work that is ergonomically difficult, fatiguing, or even unsafe.",

Typically, RFID reader communications with tags are spectrum-regulated to a narrow bandwidth that makes tag localization difficult. Moreover, RFID communications are complicated by polarization mismatches between the reader and tag antennas. The Agile RFID Antenna System is able to expand these boundaries by integrating an inexpensive frequency multiplexer to the RFID reader antennas, which permits new methods of localization, allows greater antenna functionality with fewer reader RF ports, and provides improved read accuracy and/or range. For enclosed areas, such as a large container, the Agile RFID Antenna System can use smaller antennas, consequently reducing the volume required for an RFID system to operate. A wide range of commercial applications can benefit from this technology, including retail inventory management, manufacturing/assembly line tracking, industrial transportation and logistics, sports bio-analysis, and healthcare.",

In contrast, AMTS extracts PCBs and breaks them down into benign by-products while on the structure. Therefore, no additional treatment for PCBs is required.

When the end cap covers the connector, the connector is protected. Each housing has a unique lever assembly connected to the end cap that, when squeezed, flips the end cap up to expose the connector. When in the up position, the two end caps face each other. To mate the connectors, the levers on both housings are squeezed, raising the end caps, and the two umbilicals are joined and twisted to couple them. Once the connectors are mated, the levers on both housings are released. This simultaneously seals both the umbilicals and the end caps. When dealing with cryogenic connectors, a purge can be applied to the housings to prevent icing when the connectors are demated.",

Additionally, conventional absorber coatings have a high heat capacity which impact the performance of low-background cryogenic detectors. Conventional absorber coatings also are reactive in the short wavelength limit, which correspondingly reduces their coupling efficiency. Furthermore, some thin film absorber coatings have extremely high intrinsic stress, which can cause the dielectric membranes to break or bend. The Niobium Titanium Nitride Thin Film Coating does not have these disadvantages.",

Finally, Glenn's design allows the module to operate in both pulsed and continuous wave modes, so it can singlehandedly drive exceptional performance for radar, navigation, and communications.",

The ability to reliably and efficiently monitor the temperature and rate at which surface materials deteriorate is important, especially for safety critical systems. Originally designed for use in thermal protection systems (TPS) of space vehicles, these embedded and distributed sensors foster large-area sensing.

Innovators at NASA's Glenn and Langley Research Centers are teaming to develop a compact, lightweight acoustic liner based on oxide/oxide ceramic matrix composite (CMC) materials. The CMC acoustic liner has variable-depth channels tuned to reduce broad-spectrum noise in subsonic jet engines. The design of those channels has also been focused on structures that minimize the overall liner thickness. Because the technology uses CMCs, rather than heavy metallic materials, it has the potential to reduce overall engine weight. The oxide/oxide CMC materials are able to withstand extremely high temperatures as well. These CMC acoustic liners can be used in many subsonic jet engines - particularly for next-generation aircraft - to reduce engine core noise. Also, because they can withstand high temperatures, core liners constructed with CMC materials can also provide a thermal barrier.",

      "Innovators at NASA's Glenn Research Center have developed a miniature, solid-state radiation detector that can be used in situations where compact size, low weight, and low power consumption are required. Conventional scintillator-based charged particle counters rely upon a glass photomultiplier tube (PMT) to translate light energy from the radiation source into an electrical signal. Because PMTs are bulky, fragile, and require high voltages to operate, they are not well-suited for harsh environments. Glenn's technology is solid state, thus eliminating PMTs, which means the device can operate in cramped, harsh, and low-power environments. In addition, because the detector uses a low-voltage, UV-sensitive photodiode, a wave shifter is not required, improving efficiency and further minimizing weight and bulk. Originally developed for space exploration, this compact, robust particle counter can also be used in medical dosimetry, mining, oil and gas exploration, nuclear facility monitoring, and more.",

      "New Concepts in Film Cooling for Turbine Blades",
      "To run at maximum efficiency, turbine engines often experience temperatures of more than 2000 degrees Kelvin, and these elevated temperatures can lead to compromised integrity and failure of the blades. One method for addressing this problem is film cooling, in which cool air is bled from the compressor, ducted to one or more internal chambers of the turbine blades, and discharged through one or more cooling holes to form cooling jets. As a result of the cooling jets, convective heat transfer to the surface of the turbine blade can be reduced. Innovators at NASA's Glenn Research Center have developed two new ways to improve the effectiveness of film cooling. One involves using a shaped recess to create a counter-rotating vortex pair, splitting the incoming flow to a high-energy and a low-energy stream. The other innovation employs various techniques to mitigate the aerodynamic losses that sometime accompany film cooling. These novel approaches make film cooling a much more efficient and successful means of keeping turbine blades operable.",

Previous approaches to tuning the emission from a THz QCL source have been unsatisfactory, whether because of a limited numbers of tuning channels, high cost, high complexity, or frequency instability. Glenn's scientists have devised an efficient technique that generates high-resolution tuning over a vast number of usable THz-frequencies, at commercial levels of cost and simplicity. This innovation opens a pathway to vastly expanded use of THz QCL in unprecedented terrestrial applications, including communications, homeland security screening, biomedicine, and quality control.",

The ability of the MDC to allow the fundamental frequency to propagate with negligible power losses makes it a substantial upgrade over the conventional diplexer.

After becoming heavily loaded, this filter can be cleaned automatically through a unique feed system, thereby reducing maintenance costs. In this way, the device provides a pre-filter stage that protects the more critical stages of the filter system, thereby extending the life of high-efficiency particulate arresting (HEPA) filter systems that are designed to capture fine and ultrafine particles. In an effort to reduce maintenance even further, the fine-particle filter media is provided in a scroll mechanism that is advanced to successive clean sections as needed.

Glenns innovation exploits cutting-edge SMA compositions to deliver controllable stresses in excess of 1500 megapascals (MPa), which is up to four times greater than the force exerted by commercial equiatomic SMAs. The SMA compositions are also tunable to multiple activation temperatures up to 400&deg;C, depending on the usage environments. Glenns Shape Memory Alloy Rock Splitters (SMARS) device generates this power without any demolition damage to the surrounding environment, and in a package that combines reliability, ease of setup and activation, and cost-effectiveness. This technology could prove invaluable to enterprises as varied as oil drilling, mining, civil engineering, fossil collection, and search-and-rescue operations - any field that requires compact, but large, static forces.",

      "Innovators at NASA's Glenn Research Center have devised a method for creating ultra-pure steel alloys that are free from ceramic particle contamination. These ultra-high-quality steels can be used to make bearings, gears, or any other machine components. Conventional steel alloys contain small, unwanted amounts of hard particle inclusions - or dirt - that cause weak points in the steel, making components vulnerable to failure. Such flaws act as locations for stress concentration and can form initiation sites for catastrophic fracture in mechanical parts. Glenn's newly developed process for creating steel alloys has proven to be nearly perfect, with the potential for significantly better performance than conventional steels, especially in high-stress cycle applications like rolling element bearings. These extremely clean steels are ideal for any application where unwanted contaminant inclusions stand in the way of high reliability and long-life under high load and speed operation.",

This ability enables significant increases in lateral-directional stability and control augmentation, thereby enhancing aircraft efficiency by reducing the rudder motion to control yaw. Particularly in supersonic flight, the SAW's benefits include increased compression lift and reduced wave drag. Compared to prior hydraulic-based actuators, the SMA-based actuator features significantly reduced size and weight, high specific work output, solid-state actuation, low maintenance, and high reliability.

Using a combination of sensors, engine system modeling, and compressor flow analysis code, Glenn's innovation performs real-time analysis to determine the potential of ice accretion.

      "Innovators at the NASA Glenn Research Center have developed the Cascaded Offset Optical Modulator, an electro-optic subsystem used to interface a binary output Software Defined Radio (SDR) to an optical transmission system. Traditionally, this task is accomplished through the use of a Mach Zehnder Modulator (MZM), a primarily analog component. In order to generate a high-fidelity optical signal, the input electrical signal must be of equally high fidelity, which is a difficult task due to the competing requirements of the digital components and the analog modulator. The digital components required to generate the waveform contain non-idealities which degrade the extinction ratio (ER) of the optical signal. The Cascaded Offset Optical Modulator corrects these non-idealities in the electro-optic subsystem during modulation by relieving the SDR of the extreme fidelity requirements imposed by the optical modulator. This approach is valid in any optical transmission system that requires high fidelity binary pulses without a complex component.",

Thus, such alloys show promise for metal components of gas turbines, rocket engines, nuclear reactors and other high-temperature applications. However, the conventional mechanical alloying process to produce such alloys is highly inefficient, time-consuming, and costly. By contrast, NASA's ODS-MEA is designed for production via selective laser melting. The alloy can be fabricated into complex geometries and is resistant to stress cracking and dendritic segregation.

The drive for energy efficiency in power generation and propulsion places the development of high-performance materials at the forefront of materials science. Turbine engine efficiency and reduction in carbon emissions are directly related to engine operating temperature. With increasing temperatures, materials start to plastically deform under load, a process known as creep, which sets severe limits on performance. Therefore, increased performance in aircraft engines and land-based power generators requires the development of new high-temperature structural materials that are resistant to creep. For example, a main factor prohibiting higher operating temperatures in jet turbine engines is the creep life of the Ni-based superalloy turbine disks. NASA's new superalloy composition significantly improves the creep life of turbine disks and also increases the operating temperature limit.",

Once separated, the cryogenic fluid would heat too quickly and vaporize, resulting in high, volatile pressures. To avoid these issues, cryogenic fluid had historically been controlled and redirected using either electromechanical or pneumatic actuation systems.

      "NASA Langley Research Center's portfolio of ICP measurement methods consist of the following. Monitoring ICP changes is of significant diagnostic and post-operative importance for patients with cranial injuries, pathologies or other conditions that may affect the pressure of the subarachnoidal fluid around the brain, and for patients who have undergone brain surgery. Indeed, even minor disturbances in ICP regulation can cause insidious damage to the brain. Current methods are typically cumbersome, or require invasive procedures, and/or carry side risks such as infection. Among other advantages, NASA's methods are non-invasive and allow for both short term and longer term monitoring scenarios. The use of ultra-low power ultrasonic wave intensities greatly lessens possible cumulative tissue damage.",

To take advantage of the information inherent in a sequence of 3-D images acquired at video rates, NASA Langley has also developed an embedded image processing algorithm that can simultaneously correct, enhance, and derive relative motion, by processing this image sequence into a high resolution 3-D synthetic image. Traditional scanning LIDAR techniques generate an image frame by raster scanning an image one laser pulse per pixel at a time, whereas Flash LIDAR acquires an image much like an ordinary camera, generating an image using a single laser pulse. The benefits of the Flash LIDAR technique and the corresponding image to image processing enable autonomous vision based guidance and control for robotic systems. The current algorithm offers up to eight times image resolution enhancement and well as a 6 degree of freedom state vector of motion in the image frame.",

The Molten Target Sputtering (MTS) method can increase the kinetic energy, the energy latency, and the flux density of sputtered atoms by combining the benefits of both magnetron sputtering and evaporation systems. It does this by a clever, but simple mechanical modification to the magnetron sputtering gun. For the MTS method, a simple 1~2mm (depth and width) ring-shaped groove is cut between the magnets in order to keep a gap between the copper plate and the sputtering target. This effectively is an efficiency increase to a current magnetron based sputtering machine. The ring enhances the magnetic field intensity and increases the temperature of the target material.",

Traditional sensors, such as metal oxide devices, have been utilized for several decades for detection of combustible and toxic gases. However, they are power hungry, and their use is limited. There is a strong need for development of next-generation chemical sensors with higher sensitivity in the parts per million (ppm) to parts per billion (ppb) level and low power consumption. Sensors based on emerging nanotechnology, such as SWCNTs, promise to provide improved performance.

Moreover, the mechanism of nutrient delivery to the cells is completely passive, eliminating the need for a pump. This mechanism is also independent of gravitational and inertial forces, making it an ideal candidate for human life support in space.

There are several standards for measuring data quality and voice quality over analog and digital networks, but there is no current standard measure of display motion blur. Motion blur is a significant defect of most current display technologies. Motion blur arises when the display presents individual frames that persist for significant fractions of a frame duration. When the eye smoothly tracks a moving image, the image is smeared across the retina during the frame duration. Although motion blur may be manifest in any moving image, one widely-used test pattern is a moving edge. This pattern gives rise to measurements of what is called moving-edge blur.

Sample preparation is one of the key functions in detection of biologically important organisms.

This new technology uses dielectrophoresis (DEP) effects in a non-uniform, non-constant electrical field, produced by an array of spaced-apart nanostructures (NSs) located on a substrate surface, to control particle separation. The object of the invention is to promote an accumulation/ concentration of the selected particles (e.g., biological species, such as E.Coli, salmonella, and anthrax , and non-biological materials, such as nano-and micro-particles, quantum dots, nanowires, nanotubes, and other inorganic particles) adjacent to the substrate.

No other technique can determine information content in single molecules of genetic material at speeds of 1 subunit per microsecond. Since individual molecules are counted the output is intrinsically quantitative. The nanopore approach is more generalized than any other method and may be used to analyze any polymer molecule, applying nanofabrication, nanoelectronic components, and high-speed signal acquisition. Geometry of the solid-state nanopore (less than 5 nm in length and 5 nm in diameter) will enable 1-5 nucleotide resolution measurements. This means that maximum resolution will be improved by 100-fold compared to biological ion-channel measurements. The solid-state nanopore sensor will permit sequencing DNA at a much faster rate, along with analyzing electronic properties of individual subunits of DNA or RNA, to obtain linear composition of each genetic polymer molecule.",

This makes the controller ideally suited for applications where there are unknown modelling parameters or uncertain operating environments. Many aerospace systems must function in unknown or highly variable environments. This technology allows the system to achieve its objectives in these types of unpredictable environments. In comparison to current adaptive controller technologies, the addition of residual mode filters allows operation when flexible modes are present that could inhibit the controller. This is especially useful for systems where initial modeling is costly or the fidelity of existing system models is low.",

      "NASA has developed a unique approach for an atmospheric pressure plasma-based process for fabrication of printable electronics and functional coatings. The need for low-cost and environmentally friendly processes for fabricating printable electronics and biosensor chips is rapidly growing. This plasma-based fabrication involves aerosol-assisted room temperature printing in which an aerosol carrying the desired material for deposition is introduced into a cold plasma jet operated at atmospheric pressure. The deposition is the result of the interaction of the aerosol containing the precursor material with the atmospheric pressure plasma containing a primary gas. Aerosol-assisted plasma deposition is a high throughput and facile process for printing and patterning that is easily scalable for industrial production. Multiple jets can be used for depositing different materials and the approach can be adapted to a variety of platforms and coating a variety of materials.",

NASA has developed a novel technology, a star tracker, as part of its extremely low cost commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware project. It uses relatively low power, is highly accurate, and is relatively inexpensive, uses an iterative pattern matching approach to identify a star configuration and associated spatial viewing direction in a database that corresponds to an observed star configuration. Orientation of a star configuration is confirmed by comparison of measured angular differences with angular differences contained in a database.

The CCBV is designed so that the disc rides on a cam shaft and is held rigid by a torsion spring, which provides both axial movement of the disc in addition to the standard 90 degree rotation of a standard butterfly valve. Because the valves disc can rotate and translate, it can hold a tighter seal, preventing leakage despite dimensional changes caused by changing operating temperatures.

Some mechanical and fluid systems that rely on the controlled flow of fluids between chambers will benefit from the new design. Compared to current fixed orifice devices, VARR may expand the performance envelope by offering a more continuous flow response in applications in which the pressure environment is constantly changing. Proportional two-way flow can enable a fine-tuned system response to pressure building on one side of the valve. In these changing gradient conditions, the reed valve is better than fixed-sized orifices, which are optimized for one flow condition and are likely to over- or under-restrict flow for all other flow gradients.",

      "The goal of NASA is to return humans to the surface of the moon, then journey to Mars and even beyond. In order to accomplish this ambitious goal, robust life support systems are required to operate without reliance on a resupply. The current air revitalization system on the International Space Station (ISS), the Carbon Dioxide Removal Assembly (CDRA), utilizes sorbent-based, Temperature Swing Adsorption (TSA) technology. NASA Ames has developed a reliable successor to the state-of-the-art cabin atmosphere CO<sub>2</sub> removal system. This novel patent-pending innovation takes advantages of the condensation/deposition temperature differences of air components to selectively deposit carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. CO<sub>2</sub> deposition, or CDep, is highly reliable as it has no expendable materials, no vacuum is required, and needs minimal moving parts. CDep also potentially eliminates the need for a separate storage system to deliver pressurized, pure CO<sub>2</sub> to an Oxygen generation system, such as the Sabatier processor currently on the ISS.",

This is done by etching a tiny cavity in phosphorous doped silicon, bordered by three electrodes; a source, a gate, and a drain. The source and drain are separated by 150 nanometer (nm), with the gate on top. Electrons are emitted from the source due to a voltage applied across it and the drain, while the gate controls the electron flow across the cavity. When the gap between the source and drain is of the order of 150nm the electrons do not collide. The mean free path of the electrons (the average length an electron can travel before hitting something) is more than 1micrometer (m). Advantages of the vacuum tube and transistor are combined here through nanofabrication. A photoresist ashing technique enables a nanogap separation of the emitter and the collector, thus allowing operation at less than 10V. This allows high frequency and power output while satisfying the metrics of lightness, cost, lifetime, and stability at harsh conditions.

By contrast, distributed propulsion envisions the use of multiple small electrically powered propulsion units distributed along the wings. By taking advantage of increased wing flexibility afforded by the use of light-weight materials such as composites, the aeroelastic deflection of a wing can be actively shaped in-flight for optimal aerodynamic efficiency by varying the amount of thrust generated by the propulsion units. By using distributed propulsion, the optimal wing shape can be used for other phases such as takeoff, landing, and in-flight maneuvers. In addition, distributed propulsion can be leveraged for yaw and roll controls, thus reducing the need for a full vertical tail size for weight savings. Thus, an entire aircraft design can be developed more creatively using distributed propulsion concepts for reduced fuel burn.

The determination of location and strength of shockwaves and vortices is fundamental to understanding the flow around an aircraft. These features are strong enough to affect the environment that the vehicle inhabits: for example, they can cause drag and/or produce undesirable noise. The researcher must be able to predict and mitigate the effects of these flow features. This invention is a robust visualization technique that will permit the measurement of the strengths and positions of shock waves caused by supersonic vehicles. The technique is applicable to all flight regimes, however, and can be used for visualizing tip vortices, engine exhaust plumes.",

The ideal propulsion system for small satellites is one that balances reliability, high performance, scalability, contamination issues, low pressure operation, safe propellant containment, low cost, and simple design in order to meet performance requirements. Previous attempts to utilize vacuum arc technology for spacecraft propulsion has had several issues. Currently, many vacuum arc thrusters lack a sufficient operational lifetime because of their lack of propellant feed systems. Additionally, many thrusters have uneven erosion over the cathode face, thus changing the thruster characteristics and plume direction during operation. Uneven erosion also creates macroparticles that decrease thrust. Current thrusters lack a collimated plasma plume. Lack of collimation decreases the thrust and can cause contamination issues such as resetting electronics components or coating the satellite.

An effective control strategy implies minimal energy expenditure to achieve desired flow control authority. The energy required is siphoned from the aircraft engines and is thus limited for this use. Currently, the Achilles heel of AFC systems is that the engine power drain required to activate the all flow nozzles at once exceeds the excess engine power available for this function.\nThe approach described here achieves a dramatic reduction in power/mass flow demand on the aircrafts engines during a landing approach, making AFC feasible for aircraft by re-imagining conventional approaches.

      "The Pre-Treatment Solution for Water Recovery technology was developed by NASA Johnson Space Center innovators to increase the amount of potable water recovered from the International Space Station's urine processor assembly system. Turning waste water, urine or seawater into potable water requires three important steps: 1) pre-treatment, 2) distillation or membrane filtration, and 3) transport and storage of potable water and brine. This solution is added during the first step, consequently improving the next steps in the process primarily by reducing the formation of solid precipitates. The solution reduces the amount of precipitates caused by urinary calcium, sulfate ions, and sulfuric acid; creating less acidic brines. By reducing these precipitates, less surface scaling and clogging occurs in the distillation systems and more potable water can be recovered. Also, the solution contains a biocide to prevent the growth of bacteria, thereby increasing storage time and the amount of water recovered. This NASA technology is available for licensing.",

The new material improves toughness and damping properties of PMCs, enhancing impact resistance, fatigue life, and structural longevity. Historically, PMCs have provided insufficient toughness for some aerospace structures. Rubber toughening agents and thermoplastics are often employed to increase material toughness, but such additives increase viscosity of polymer resins and increase processing difficulty and cost. Other reinforcements like aramids exist, but also have inherent issues (e.g., Kevlar absorbs moisture which adds weight and is susceptible to degradation upon UV exposure). NASA's new carbon fiber-CNT yarn hybrid material displays excellent toughness and strength for reinforcing PMC materials while also mitigating issues associated with current hybrid reinforcements like rubber, thermoplastics, and aramids.",

Used to make aerospace parts and wind-turbine blades, AFP employs a robotic arm to apply strips of carbon fiber prepreg (aka composite tape, or tows) to build up a composite part layer by layer. While advantageous, any imperfectly placed (or slipped) tows generate lap-and-gap defects relative to adjacent tows which can degrade structural integrity by as much as 30%. Currently, manual visual inspection is used to identify and fix such defects before curing, which is highly labor intensive. In-situ inspection systems are emerging, but no method exists to create accurate \"defect standards\" to facilitate active system calibration.

TED uses disruptive modal coupling between two different structures, each with their own vibrational behavior, to provide vibration damping for one or both of the structures. This novel reactive vibration damping method uses feedback from the vibrational displacement itself, such as the tension and compression cycles from the movement of the vibrating structure (like a wind turbine or tower), to disrupt the vibration. Line tension is provided by either hydraulic, pneumatic, or magnetic means to suit the application and the size/ displacement of the vibration.

These durable polyimide aerogels are highly flexible and foldable in contrast to traditional silica aerogels, which shed dust particles and are notoriously fragile and brittle. Polyimide aerogels possess remarkable strength, flexibility, and moisture resistance and make excellent \"wrappable\" insulators. No other aerogel possesses the compressive and tensile strength of this organic polyimide aerogel while still retaining its ability to be flexibly folded to contour to whatever shape is needed such as automotive shields, pipeline insulation, and protective clothing. Glenn's durable polyimide aerogels combine the robust nature of a polyimide network with low thermal and sound conductivity. This unique combination of strength, flexibility, and exceptional insulating properties make these aerogels ideal for insulation (thermal, electrical, and acoustic), structural elements and more - at a fraction of the weight of similar materials.",

The use of a magnetically controlled relief valve as opposed to a spring-based relief valve enables quick-open on/off relief operation when overpressure is reached. This is due to the rapid decay of the magnetic field as the fluid medium pushes the valve poppet to an open position. Spring-based relief valves require increasing pressure and force to continually compress the spring and open the relief valve. This requirement greatly complicates the design of a system relief mechanism. A magnetic relief valve reduces these design complexities by eliminating the spring.\n\nThe relief valve mechanism is fully sealed and is isolated from the flow path of the fluid/gas media.

      "Innovators at NASA's Glenn Research Center have developed a new method for making small diameter, high-grade Nickel Titanium (NiTi) ball bearings that set a new standard for precision performance in the bearing field. Using non-corrosive NiTi alloy instead of steel is an inexpensive way to increase the load capability and reduce the weight of a ball bearing. It has been difficult, however, to produce balls less than 0.375\" in diameter using the standard baseline 60NiTi alloy. To address this challenge, Glenn innovators have created a new, more advanced alloy consisting of NiTi and Hafnium (Hf) that can produce high-quality ball bearings of any size, but most notably less than 0.25\" in diameter. Glenn's NiTi-Hf ball bearings are superior to any previously used alloy or steel. They are corrosion-resistant, shockproof, and have been rated at a grade 10 or higher on the Annular Bearing Engineering Committee (ABEC) scale (an industry-accepted tolerance standard for bearings). Thanks to their high strength and Rockwell hardness (HRC 58-60), these customizable ball bearings will facilitate new high-speed precision applications in a broad range of industries, including aerospace, automotive, industrial, medical, and more.",

Upon exposing the material to moderate temperatures (greater than 300&deg;C) in the presence of oxygen, the metastable phase is further oxidized, and the material becomes insulating while retaining its high toughness and microstructure. With this innovation, a coating can be created from any metal oxide, including rare earth oxides, zirconium oxide, hafnium oxide, titanium oxide, or any combination of two or more oxides. Glenn's innovation has great potential for industries that require increasingly tough ceramic coatings, such as electronics, chemical and petroleum refineries, the aerospace industry, and automotive and aeronautics manufacturing.",

Although current SiC pressure sensors can operate at 800&#176C inside combustion chambers, the output response is sensitive to temperature changes and requires temperature compensation schemes that rely on a second separate temperature sensor to get a true measure of pressure. The new NASA pressure/temperature (P/T) sensor chip enables real-time translation of pressure and uses only a single tap for two engine measurements.

This novel liquid-assisted MMC recovers the strength of the structure after a healing cycle. The MMC contains both shape memory alloy (SMA) reinforcements and some low-melting phase components which, when heated, essentially clamp the crack edges back together and flow material into the crack's gap for a high strength repair. While current crack repair methods exist, such as doublers or welding overlays, these methods require complex surface prep and bonding, which can be difficult and may result in a region of decreased strength.
